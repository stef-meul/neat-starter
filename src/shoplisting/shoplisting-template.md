### Item category (pieces, products, etc)

item description... I’m interested in sharing with persons that want to share the responsibilities, risks and benefits. At this moment I’m thinking about a modus operandi that can be summed up in.

Thinking about these possibilities of allowing spaces to exist in between the institutional and the market oriented, has often brought me to a dependency on both welfare/funding and selling of time/labour. My main concern is related to other forms of exploitation/exchange of value, which benefit both from market and state interaction, to gather resources for artists to have abundant time and necessary means to develop research and practice which does not have to be profit driven, neither contribute to propagate society at large. At the same time to refrain from withdrawing from the world into niche communities, precarity, cults and religious interpretations of contemporary cultures - rather belonging to the world into a different paradigm, a practice of im/possibility with a commitment that extends beyond academic reflection, a side gig besides real work, an addon to a curriculum vitae that scores well, etc. Instead engaging in an artistic practice wherein the ecology-economy and the personal liability is at stake, where things do matter for real and money needs to be available in exchange for time and resources on the short and the long run, changing the position from where artistic practice reflects on society. Not how to, but why put your money where your mouth is?
