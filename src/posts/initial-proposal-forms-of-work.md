***"In a post-bubble era, what would be fun to do with a gallery."***

![wsf](/static/img/img_20210603_104647-copy.jpg "wsf")

Do you want to be part of a cooperative, share programming an art space, give care to your own gallery/atelier? 

Experiment with a paradox, i.e. how not to: curate, commercialise, gentrify, be viable at the grace of the state? Keeping it real: no pseudo family company non-profit nonsense. Ok, then what?

I don’t know the future, I work with what is, I can share these resources, develop work and benefits with artists that share the responsibility of our activity. 

I don’t expect myself to be successful and I don’t measure others on popularity or virtuosity. \
Art happens to be the thing that makes sense to be busy with most of the time.
