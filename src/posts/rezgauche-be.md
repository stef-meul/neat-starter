## project

### Introduction

*rezgauche.be* was conceived in 2019 from a desire to transit from a curated art gallery to a decentralised organisation. 

In the workshop “debunking the myth” given by Elke van Campenhout for the Advanced Performance and Scenography Studies (apass.be), Stef Meul started to rethink the possibilities of reshaping the use of his gallery/atelier. 

He devised three initial paths to transit from a curated situation: 

1. Work with Smart Activity to create artistic employment.
2. Start a cooperative model to diversify the stakeholders and share the responsibility. 
3. Make a DAO and/or a DISCO and develop the gallery/atelier as a smart contract.



*rezgauche.be* is an open invitation to artists, commoners and organisations within and beyond already developed communities and extensive networks.

*rezgauche.be* is responsive to a need for an immediate representation of artists, balancing responsibility with decentralised organisation.



### Locality

*rezgauche.be* has its main node at the gallery/atelier located at Rue Theodore Verhaegen 154, Brussels. 

Adjacent to the multi-purpose gallery/atelier there is a small communal kitchen, restrooms, a courtyard, and a basic underground home studio, suitable for graphic design, making d.i.y. fanzines, music production and audiovisual post-production. Above the gallery, in a small colocation, a studio apartment for hosting artists in residency will become available in the near future.

In the area, Porte-de Halle, Place Bethlehem, there are lots of little restaurants, shops,  supermarkets, cultural venues (Tricoterie des Liens, Pianofabriek, Jacques-Frank) and art venues (Deborah Bowman, Alma Sarif). On walking distance there is the Wiels contemporary art center, Midi Station, Duden Parc, P.A.R.T.S, Communa asbl Maxima site, Artist Commons asbl Chassart studio, Parvis Saint-Gilles, Place Jeu de balle, etc.

A large window at the street side lends itself to a view into the gallery. Yet, there is no door that gives front access. Visitors need to pass through the gate and the courtyard before entering the space, which allows for a sense of distance between persons at work and mere passersby.

This display towards the street side has proven itself to be very useful for visual and performance artworks. The performances are viewable from the street, framed within the gallery’s window, sometimes causing consternation because of non-heteronormative interaction, lack of decent costumes, etc.

If performing happens with a public on the street side, the performance’s sound can be made audible by amplifying the indoor sound through the basement studio ventilation, making it audible outdoors.

Alternatively, by adding a curtain, then events can happen in a more relaxed intimate setting between the persons present. This is often easier when working with research, rehearsals, meetings, meditations, preparing exhibitions, etc. And if the weather allows, the courtyard is nice for gatherings, reflection, and occasional events. 

Specific to this location is that nothing (creations, material, artworks, etc) can be placed in the corridors, courtyard, or outside the area of the gallery/atelier, because this obstructs the common use of the building’s occupants. That means in quotidian practice that how you make/do things has to include considering any residuals of your practice. With late night events, the neighbours need to be involved somehow, and/or reduce the volume of evocative noises and music, so that the kids and early hard working adults can enjoy their beauty sleep.



## Purpose

*rezgauche.be* is reshaping commoning: thinking, developing and practising inclusive structures that balance responsibility, resources and stakeholdership with participation and decentralised forms of organisation. 

### \
Activities

#### S.W.E.A.T.

*Softly We Entered Another Truth* is rethinking work through practice. It wants to put into question the value of the body: its products, services and experiences. 

S.W.E.A.T. asks: What is performance in context of an insubstantial artform? How can performance art extend beyond a notion of labour time, or beyond valorisation of excessive (re)actions? 

Artists are invited to experiment and present the process in an informal, professional, post-work society. Frequency and format of presentation is following the artistic process. Resources, benefits, risks and responsibilities are shared.

*Softly We Entered Another Truth* functions as an experimental practice of a life beyond capitalist consumer culture and engages participants through displacement into artistic practice, love and care. 



#### Art Research 

A.R. is an open space for engaging with the research process of the participants. It shapes itself along the artistic research proposals by the artists present. The participants can share the research with each other, reflect on each others work, but can also just work by themselves. *Art Research* can be open to the public and guests can be invited, whenever the researchers want to include this in their process.

A.R. happens monthly or bi-monthly, and can include the participants of the A.i.R. 

## participation

### A.i.R.

rezgauche.be  launches an open call in summer of 2021, inviting artists to apply for a residency.

The residency can be one, two or three weeks in duration. 

Artists can apply as individuals or as part of a collective, an organisation, etc. 

The applicant needs to define the starting date of their residency.

A project description is requested, with emphasis to BE PRACTICAL in the proposal - with openness to changes according to the project’s situation/inspiration during the residency.  

The applicant is requested to describe the economy of their proposal: values, consumption, production, funds, donations, exchange, benefits, etc.  \
\
A.i.R application form: <https://framaforms.org/artist-residency-application-1625905255> 



The rezgauche.be A.i.R. selection criteria are based on:

1. complete application
2. inclusivity: how to make it possible?
3. time-space compatibility
4. available resources
5. desire for responsibility

   Artistic autonomy of the projects in residence and the artist’s care for the workspace: before, during and after their residency - are considered important. The decisions for selection are made by the stakeholders of *rezgauche.be* and will happen through a participants meeting, and/or by online voting on the proposals in a dao/disco\
   [https://elements.disco.coop](https://elements.disco.coop/)



### OpenCollective

To become a participant *rezgauche.be* and develop its financial structure, a collective fund is organised through [opencollective.com](https://opencollective.com/).

This allows for a transparent insight in the funds, costs and expenses of *rezgauche.be*. 

A fiscal host takes care of the financial administration. Donation and funding can be requested and received through *opencollective.com* and the fiscal host can provide tax deductible proofs for persons and organisations that would like to finance, fund, support and sponsor *rezgauche.be*.

Employment in *rezgauche.be* can happen through the Verenigde Producties vzw (Smart Activity transdisciplinary art foundation, project rez gauche), for example by invoicing the opencollective.



### Sputnik Dao

To be a stakeholder of *rezgauche.be* and decide on its participants' proposals, the formation of a dao and/or a disco will take place. 

To develop this practice, *rezgauche.be*’s stakeholders will create a dao on the Near protocol blockchain. <https://www.sputnik.fund/#/select-dao>. This makes it possible for persons to engage with *rezgauche.be*’s organisation remotely and asynchronously - wherever you have internet access and at your own rhythm.

The Near blockchain has very low network fees, human readable addresses, fast transaction times, proof of stake, the aurora bridge for cross chain transactions, and is climate neutral <https://near.org/blog/the-near-blockchain-is-climate-neutral/> - therefore making sputnik dao an interesting decentralised technology to start with when compared to aragon on ethereum, or the disco tech stack which is, at the time of writing this text, still in its development stage. In a later stage *rezgauche.be* will research the possibility of developing a smart contract for its location and its activities, in an nft format with the *mintbase.io* technology on the Near network.

A workshop to initiate the *rezgauche.be* dao, and voting on its procedures will be organised with participants and stakeholders. Documentation will be made available to new participants and help provided where needed.



## network

In an initial stage *rezgauche.be* will build on the contacts and nodes connected to the professional initiatives, social networks and personal acquaintances of Stef Meul[ transdisciplinary.art/stef-meul](https://transdisciplinary.art/stef-meul).

In peer-2-peer practice, the initial contacts are encouraged to connect to their social base, causing the network to become more robust and decentralised. A reference person can act as an introduction between participants, to build trust and share responsibility among the network constituents.

Persons with affinity with *rezgauche.be*’s purpose are also welcome to join without any prior connection to its network. In due time rezgauche.be will expand into the global commons, while allowing its local base to be accessible through sharing responsibility with its diversified participants.
