*Softly We Entered Another Truth* is rethinking work through practice. It wants to put into question the value of the body: its products, services and experiences.

*S.W.E.A.T*. asks: What is performance when placed in a context of a non-essential, an insubstantial form of art? How can performance art extend beyond a notion of labour time, or beyond valorisation of excessive (re)actions?

*Rez gauche* invites you - artists, researchers, makers, performers, etc - to experiment with our research process in an informal, professional, post-work society. Frequency and format of presentation is following the artistic process. Resources, benefits, risks and responsibilities are shared.

*Softly We Entered Another Truth* functions as an experimental practice of a life beyond capitalist consumer culture and engages participants through displacement into artistic practice, love and care.\
\
In the November edition of s.w.e.a.t. the focus is on developing an economy of solidarity. rezgauche.be proposes a situation where artists can present their work and benefit from donations made to the collective. By gathering into a collection and coupling an authentic digital version of the work, the artists can benefit from any potential change of ownership of their work, creating an economy of solidarity between the participants.
