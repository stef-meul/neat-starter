## DEBUNKING THE MYTH

    Many teachers in the world are teaching at the same time. Therefore it is difficult to hear. What is deep listening meaning to people practicing it<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<3

Love is an initiative. Or not? What is love ?                                                                                                                         Knowing the unknown is a possibility as well, 

Aswell……………………………………………………………………………………………………

TRUST 

The unknown is coming 

How do I relate with has is coming 

If my weapons are down 

How to be profund

Without 

The 

Pain

FEAR 

Love disappears 

I cannot see it anymore

Blindness has my heart 

In it’s hands 

I am struggling

Love is something I can rely on.

Many years ago, I had a conversation about how love is a plural being. Some of its limbs and organs can be named with words of friendship, family, romance, Walt Disney, or the terrifying feeling of falling and being devoured by one of its bodily openings. What does it mean to see this body of love not as a natural beast, but as a cyborg?
