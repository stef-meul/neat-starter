## DEBUNKING THE MYTH


### *Alienation from self?, heritage, belonging and connection*

I am concerned with the harnesses I and others built to make life under current systems livable. And how - after some time - these harnesses don’t easily get acknowledged by people wearing them and become some kind of second patch-worked skin of stimulus that guides us.

I’m thinking of my grandfather who’s dying and my father who can’t talk about it. ⇒ protecting from hurt, emotional concern

I’m thinking about the huge amount of pesticides my grandfather and many other farmers have been exposed to and him not considering to stop using it. ⇒ protecting a family, ecological and health concern

In my research I’m thinking of ritualistic places where harnesses can be revealed or put aside by some sort of witchcraft. What do these places look like and how do they function? Are they safe, or is it important that they are unsafe? In which different way can this witchcraft work, other than shaming and blaming like catholicism did?

Witchcraft is becoming a harness too. “Safe” sounds like a category of predictability - can we assure that nothing we don’t want to be accountable for will happen? Are all these, harness (I assume criticality and discourse is meant by it), witchcraft, catholicism devices for preserving an imagined order or are they, can they be in function of catalysing a change of the order?\
\

* Where does one encounter contemporary space-times of liminality?
* When we go underground? Or maybe at the crossroads. When I dance. In the airport. On a long bus ride. At 4 am. 
* What is the harness of witchcraft?

What does a space goblin, a zombie and a vampire have in common? Think of the goblin guarding the inside, afraid of losing the preciousness of an inner world. The zombie cares more for the beverage than the person on the date. The vampire shrivels at the thought of a regular day job, and above all craves for love to replenish the hole where once was its unbroken heart.

They don’t exist in a scientific worldview. They belong to an imagined order, which nonetheless functions similar to a scientific worldview.

In the Roman empire the children were considered the property of the parents.\
Can I desire beyond the dual drive for being a protector of the child or of freeing a wild being appealing to a greater being to guide its unruliness? 

The voice in the back of the head  --- (where my demon appeared to be situated) mine too...in the right ear more or less actually

In my practice I have the tendency to follow a certain direction, path, themes and way of working for an extended period of time and when I think I know this direction and feel like I might  identify myself too much with the work or others identify me with it too much, I pull the break in order to forcefully pull myself out of a workflow to become aware of my way of working. This very much has to do with a voice in the back of my head which is critical towards choices I make and I wonder if this voice in the back of my head is not overdetermined with “political correctness” and norms that the cultural field inherently and sometimes silently puts over work. So I seem to pull a break to free myself from choices I made myself and lead others maybe astray? But the braking is a violent act leaving me practice-less for a period of time and kind of in limbo. Which is something not necessarily negative for an artist but does not feel comfortable either. So how can you free work from critique either a projected one or from oneself, without being uncritical toward work and oneself?\
\

* What happens along the way - Where do you end up when you continue moving in said direction, even after realising it is ‘the wrong way’? 
* How do you perceive the surroundings along the route then? - Will you start moving differently, without having changed your ‘way’?
* Is this possible without fear/danger?

...no lo dejes apagar.
