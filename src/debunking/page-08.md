## DEBUNKING THE MYTH


### Sorry for rambling

One of my favorite James Baldwin quotes

“..because only an artist can tell, and only artists have told since we have heard of man, what it is like for anyone who gets to this planet to survive it. What it is like to die, or to have somebody die; what it is like to be glad. Hymns don’t do this, churches really cannot do it. The trouble is that although the artist can do it, the price that he has to pay himself and that you, the audience, must also pay, is a willingness to give up everything, to realize that although you spent twenty-seven years acquiring this house, this furniture, this position, although you spent forty years raising this child, these children, nothing, none of it belongs to you. You can only have it by letting it go. You can only take if you are prepared to give, and giving is not an investment. It is not a day at the bargain counter. It is a total risk of everything, of you and who you think you are, who you think you’d like to be, where you think you’d like to go — everything, and this forever, forever.”

“..because only a scientist can tell, and only scientists have told since we have heard of man, what it is like for anyone who gets to this planet to survive it. What it is like to die, or to have somebody die; what it is like to be glad. Hymns don’t do this, churches really cannot do it. The trouble is that although the scientist can do it, the price that he has to pay himself and that you, the audience, must also pay, is a willingness to give up everything, to realize that although you spent twenty-seven years acquiring this house, this furniture, this position, although you spent forty years raising this child, these children, nothing, none of it belongs to you.

English Subtitles and being useful / spoilt / working with state funding from a government that doesn’t want you / artists changing the world - audience / feeling alienated as an artist / the desire to justify your work]

Why are there two introductions to the Science of Logic? Freud wasn’t yet born. But a frog defecates in a pond, twice, in an era before the written language.

“I say that, because inside of non dual is of course non attachment,”

I’d say non-dual is not judging the attachment or trying not to, there’s an intent there, but paced, tamed perhaps, so the attempt itself does not turn into doubling down on the original attachment.
