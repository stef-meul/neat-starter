## DEBUNKING THE MYTH

**THE BUNK BEDS WHERE CATHOLIC GUILT AND NEO-LIBERAL ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS ARE SNORING**. I’m concerned with the lingering effects of the moral notion of guilt in Flanders (maybe coming from Western Europe). What are the after-effects of the endeavours of the boomer-generation to escape the grasp of Catholicism that was still very much present in social life during the 60’s and 70’s? Is it possible this struggle led to some form of transgenerational trauma? Is this a socially shared concern or just a personal case, dealing with the relationship between me and my father? Which lines can be drawn between this moral view of guilt (that we supposedly have left behind) and the economic view on debt of neo-liberalism that is now determining the conditions we live/sleep under? 

I would say catholicism has affected me as well, although I don’t know if it did in the same way-I can relate to my father as someone that I loved and I still love without knowing how. And maybe catholic GOD is playing me good. I think it is a matter of concern I was not aware last week. How is my relation with men affecting my artistic, spiritual, affective and theoretical practice? Is this challenging me in some way?

AM I SUPPOSE TO ENCARNATE A ROLE THAT HAS HURT ME IN ORDER TO BE MORE THAN WHAT I ALREADY AM BECAUSE OF MY DESIRE OF SURVIVE AND BE PART? Belonging should not hurt, right?

My matter of concern is what are the sites of instituting (new) forms of sensing that I can influence or have an effect on. The sites are numerous and different in how they shape senses; I’m thinking from pop-culture, to wellness-industry, the arts in general, dance pedagogy, cultural, social arenas and practices that have an elaborate, whether more or less explicit idea of the body and the “training, constructing” of it.

I guess there’s a hidden matter of concern - the “real” effects of my work, of one’s work, material effects perhaps. That would further point at the desire to grasp the causality at best, but let’s go for relation between immaterial and material. Material in this case is bodily experience, patterns of sensing and acting upon them. How can we speculate the future from our senses differently than under the dominance of visual perception?
