## DEBUNKING THE MYTH

### COOPERATIVE

I’m thinking about changing the way the workplace that has been established as a curated project, into a cooperative. My research about commons has brought me to a splace where I’d like to start an experiment with this workspace/gallery. I’m interested in sharing with persons that want to share the responsibilities, risks and benefits. At this moment I’m thinking about a modus operandi that can be summed up in:\
\

1. a person that needs to rent a space, can do so through my Smartbe.be activity. In that sense I can invoice the organisation/person and with that budget create artistic employment for myself and participants when doing artistic work. This means in practice that most persons that I know, are not able to provide for such a space, because to arrive at a minimum 35,23 euro netto salary that only covers the costs and rent of the space, an invoice of 84,18* euro inclusive 21% tax and 6,5% administration costs has to be made per day for using such a space.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pnObtI5n9FnKrIer7jNJn2qWnd1QMKYp5Na4TH2VI-s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">(source)</a>

2. connecting with a decentralised autonomous organisation. Organising the space through ethereum based Smart contracts and interacting with the <a href="https://app.tryroll.com/token/MOTION" target="_blank"> Motion token </a> developed by Marlon Barrios Solano from <a href="http://www.dance-tech.net/" target="_blank">dance-tech.net</a>. This would in practice mean that the gallery space develops a contract that can be exchanged. A clear convention regarding liabilities and regulations regarding the rental contract and utility bills, and all other terms and conditions related to access, use and care of the space and its communal areas, need to be included in the protocol of providing a non-curated, non-commercial, non-institutional, common workspace for artistic research and presentation on a distributed ledger through a ethereum based smart contract.
3. When possible, starting a public foundation, which functions as the intergenerational safeguard of its common property and is defined constitutionally to interact with society for the benefit of artists and artistic work. The identity of the artist can be thought of as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lyGeROBG0Q" target="_blank">M+ concept of subjectivity<a/> (Zizek et al.).

Thinking about these possibilities of allowing spaces to exist in between the institutional and the market oriented, has often brought me to a dependency on both welfare/funding and selling of time/labour. My main concern is related to other forms of exploitation/exchange of value, which benefit both from market and state interaction, to gather resources for artists to have abundant time and necessary means to develop research and practice which does not have to be profit driven, neither contribute to propagate society at large. At the same time to refrain from withdrawing from the world into niche communities, precarity, cults and religious interpretations of contemporary cultures - rather belonging to the world into a different paradigm, a practice of im/possibility with a commitment that extends beyond academic reflection, a side gig besides real work, an addon to a curriculum vitae that scores well, etc. Instead engaging in an artistic practice wherein the ecology-economy and the personal liability is at stake, where things do matter for real and money needs to be available in exchange for time and resources on the short and the long run, changing the position from where artistic practice reflects on society. Not how to, but why put your money where your mouth is?
