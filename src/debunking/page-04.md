## DEBUNKING THE MYTH


### NON-DUAL (IN) DIFFERENCE

To practice a non-dual stance for me is a pragmatic way out of the truth-game of critical exchange. Not so much to replace it, as to offer a wider ground of agonism on which we can still recognize the common ground beneath our concerns as speaking partners. To embrace the non-dual out of its spiritual context, however, often meets with the resistance of this being an escapist way out of the real, situated here and now. How to engage from a non-dual ground into situated practices and pay respect to what is? How not to seem in-different: not respecting identitary, economic, historical and other differences?  > is making visible the seams that weave together the indifferent patches of fabric enough?\

once within the non-dual frame , when there is not a specific correctness to be found or even rubric to formulate off of, how to be able to know, what you are doing(what the aim is, when the technology at use is radical acceptance?)
