## DEBUNKING THE MYTH


### HOW TO DIE IN A GOOD WAY? (HOW TO LIVE IN A GOOD WAY)

It seems that, if driven to its radical potential, non-duality could have the ability to make one rather fearless? I say that, because inside of non dual is of course non attachment, and a person without attachments is one who has nothing to fear, in a sense they are already dead, fully alive, however we might see it. 

To me there exists something juicy here, that is how to die in a good way? I’m curious somehow of how the context of artistic research can be a container to explore death within, or if it can be a place to do this in? I see many valuable offerings it could have

\-once dead , it's possible to talk to ghosts, why talk to ghosts? Because maybe they have something to say.

\-given that the planet is going through the 6th extinction perhaps research is needed on what it is to die, what it is like to die, and how to do so in a good way? There are many people who’ve done this research before of course, during the aids crisis, during the many apocalypse that different sects of humans have undergone. Perhaps this tactic or technology of non-dualism can be a mode of this research. But once within the non-dual frame , when there is not a specific correct answer to be found or even rubric to formulate off of, how to be able to know, what you are doing(what the aim is when the technology at use is radical acceptance?) …

\-once dead, there is an embedded “freedom”(connectedness) , the choice to do, to choose, what moves (you)through you, perhaps. If i'm thinking of an artist as a muse, a vessel, a portal, a potential for a device for divine, whether the divine is foucault or the divine feminine (perhaps they one and the same anyhow), then within death is perhaps located the ability to fully commit, to be fully present. I also feel here a connection to the latour text, as he spoke about types of critique- people projecting fake meaning into what they are doing, people being simply vessels to be moved by a larger force unbeknownst to them. In death there could exist a third option, although i'm unsure of how it could be called. A dance between it all stories being fake and then allowing the fakeness to guide real material actions that we both could predict the consequences of and also not.
