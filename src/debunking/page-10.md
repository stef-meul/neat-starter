## DEBUNKING THE MYTH


### INTIMATE VERSUS PERSONAL

There is something impossible in this confrontation. The two terms point at completely different regimes to inhabit the very moment of decision taking. 

Playing the game of etymology goes very revealing.

“Personal” comes from the persona as  the actor’s mask character in a play. A person can only show in a theater. A referential frame that keeps us oriented by a specific value system. A regime of representation. A regime of anticipation (debt)

If, by the other side, we look at “intimate”, we can see the “in-” doesn’t work as the opposite of out (in-and-out), but as “inter”: what is in between, among,  if we don’t want to reduce the complexity of this “in-”.

When the noun becomes a verb, ….when we intimate, when we share intimacy with, we’re sharing the in between, sharing an affect,  we are among.

Is there Oxana’s soul as a passage?

A short of catch me if you can. You will never take me on stage. 

A regime of immanence. A regime of spontaneity. 

How do the two regimes deal with each other?

What’s the cat-and mouse play?

Not enough is enough. 

Fuego! ….no lo dejes apagar.
