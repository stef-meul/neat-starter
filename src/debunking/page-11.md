## DEBUNKING THE MYTH


V ersus: from a medieval Latin use of Latin versus ‘towards’\
I ntimate: from late Latin intimatus, past participle of Latin intimare ‘impress, make familiar’\
P ersonal: from Latin persona ‘actor's mask, character in a play’

My concern is that I am becoming reactionary - the values of my upbringing and education, that I believe I have already distilled and weeded out, are under threat. Just when you feel you’re starting to comprehend the world, it changes. The frameworks through which I partake and receive the world are diluting, transforming. I am appalled by finding out that I’m often driven by resentment towards newer generations that “have it easier”.  I’ve let myself be convinced that taking on certain struggles is necessary or even the most human experience, completing, enriching the spirit. So easy and so many reasons to become bitter. How to support and contribute to the betterment of the future if my values are greatly differing from the current ones, that have the momentum and are gaining podium. How important is it to be on the “right side of the history”? How (far) can I sacrifice the sense of safety for a necessary, but not necessarily better change, a new paradigm is promising and disrupting the status quo with? 

Some concerns are not concerns anymore, but are unresolved emotional conflicts that solidified into an opinion without any umbilical cord to the alive matter of the concern.

“I simply want to do what every good military officer, at

regular periods, would do: retest the linkages between the new threats he

or she has to face and the equipment and training he or she should have in

order to meet them—and, if necessary, to revise from scratch the whole

paraphernalia. This does not mean for us any more than it does for the

officer that we were wrong, but simply that history changes quickly and that

there is no greater intellectual crime than to address with the equipment

of an older period the challenges of the present one.

…

My argument is that a certain form of critical spirit has sent us down the

wrong path, encouraging us to fight the wrong enemies and, worst of all,

to be considered as friends by the wrong sort of allies because of a little

mistake in the definition of its main target. The question was never to get

away from facts but closer to them, not fighting empiricism but, on the con-

trary, renewing empiricism.” (Latour, Critical inquiry)

The desire to desire. After I got excited, frustrated, satisfied, happy, and bored by the phenomenal sensory stimulation within the empty house. My concentration, interest and care for the content of the matter degraded, like the fatigue of trying to read a chapter too much, late at night alone with a free copy of a book by Hegel in english.

Maybe ingesting something: sugar, salt, smoke, tea, coffee, nicotine, pleasure, rest, etc. Why can’t I do without? And why do I attach to the pleasure of doing without? I met my soulmate at the drive in of a fast food chain restaurant, because we got into an argument about which dressing was the most tasty to dip the stir fried onion rings, or were it octopus rings? Too hard to think beyond a lifetime.

What’s love got to do with it? Could I read [Meeting the universe halfway quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacecc5sm4djkalivnwyo4lqb4ai2ft7dbkdctpwxoh2fuyq3bgce6ku?filename=Karen%20Barad%20-%20Meeting%20the%20universe%20halfway*%20quantum%20physics%20and%20the%20entanglement%20of%20matter%20and%20meaning%20%20-Duke%20University%20Press%20%282007%29.pdf*)(*) while reading [The ticklish subject - the absent core of political ontology](*https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzacecv3reg7umqjlvl6ozaoahxkauamnk5ab25bstd2bvsg5jqdiu7fk?filename=Slavoj%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEek%20-%20The%20Ticklish%20Subject*%20The%20Absent%20Centre%20of%20Political%20Ontology-Verso%20%282000%29.pdf)* and rethink the theses of these works within the work of Byron Katie? My mind jumps into culture vulture’s lyrics ‘adhd, the disease of the century that’s me’. My concern is that academic rigour is lost among the lifestyle of smartphone updates, that the time it takes to bring a thorough work into existence, doesn’t fit the scattered and fleeting subject matters of seasonal academic fashions. Never mind reading Merleau Ponty during the first confinement wave or bother with Agamben’s emergency state’s law enforcement. How to belong to Harari’s useless class and work on practices that present themselves useless to the surveillance state, yet can proliferate within it and render the importance of hegemony to the relative dustbins of history?

Does the whispering bother you when you pretend to sleep?
